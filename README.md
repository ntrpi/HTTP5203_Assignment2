<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

HTTP5203 focuses on data management using XML. The goal of this assignment was to create a ticket system with a "chat" feature that allows support staff to communicate with a customer about the problem the customer is having with a product.

You will see this is a very rudimentary system. For example, the user management is completely manual, having to select yourself as the user sending a particular message, instead of using .NET's authentication and authorization functionality. However, since the purpose of this course is to manage data using XML, those features were put aside.

Styling is also quite rudimentary, relying mostly on views generated by .NET with minor modifications.


### Built With

* [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to download and install Visual Studio Community 2019.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ntrpi/HTTP5203_Assignment2.git
   ```
2. Install additional NuGet packages
   * Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc
   * Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Core
   * Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
    <br />
   I recognize that you probably shouldn't need or even have both AspNet and AspNet.Core in the same project, and I can't remember exactly why I have both. However, despite a couple of warnings, it seems to work.




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To create a ticket, first create a user element. From the home page click on the Users button, then click Create New. Enter the information on the next page, selecting User Type Customer. Click Create.

There are two ways to create a ticket. The first is from the users page. On the users page, find your newly created users and click on Details. Towards the bottom of the page is a button labeled "New Ticket". This will take you to the new ticket page.

The other way is to click on the Tickets button from the home page. This will take you to a list of existing tickets. Click New Ticket near the top of the page to go to the new ticket page.

Enter the information to create a ticket. Once submitted, we can pretend that it was received by customer support and assigned to someone. That someone would then view the ticket, then click Send Message to communicate with the user.

Again, the biggest shortcoming of this system is having to select yourself as the user for creating tickets and sending messages. That would be the next significant improvement.

The other thing that I would like is to have the email input for customers on the same page as the user creation. I couldn't get the JS to work for that.
